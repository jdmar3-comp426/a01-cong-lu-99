    <h1>The Thunder Beings</h1>
    <p>The Thunder beings are a clan of powerful storm spirits who live in the sky and command thunder and lightning.
        They are human in form, unlike many tribes where thunder spirits appear as birds.
        In some Cherokee communities, the Thunderers are believed to be the the sons of the corn mother Selu
        (also known as the Thunder Boys) and their descendants.
        In other communities the Thunder Boys are considered distinct from the Ani-Hyuntikwalaski,
        with the Thunder Boys belonging to the sacred mythic era, and the Ani-Hyuntikwalaski
        belonging to the material world. </br> </br>
        The Thunder beings dress in lightning and rainbows.
        The priests pray to the thunder and he visits the people to bring rain and blessings from the South.
        It was believed that the thunder beings who lived close to the Earth's surface in the cliffs, mountains,
        and waterfalls could harm the people at times, which did happen. These other thunders are always plotting mischief.
