    <h1>Medicine and disease</h1>
    <p>It is said that all plants, animals, beasts and people once lived in harmony 
        with no separation between them. At this time, the animals were bigger and stronger 
        until the humans became more powerful. When the human population increased, 
        so did the weapons, and the animals no longer felt safe. The animals decided to 
        hold a meeting to discuss what should be done to protect themselves.</br> </br>
        The Bears met first and decided that they would make their own weapons like the humans, 
        but this only led to further chaos. Next the Deer gathered to discuss their plan of action 
        and they came to the conclusion that if a hunter was to kill a Deer, they would develop a disease. 
        The only way to avoid this disease was to ask the Deer's spirit for forgiveness. 
        Another requirement was that the people only kill when necessary. 
        The council of Birds, Insects and small animals met next and they decided that 
        humans were too cruel, therefore they concocted many diseases to infect them with. </br> </br>
        The plants heard what the animals were planning and since they were always friendly with the humans, 
        they vowed that for every disease made by the animals, they would create a cure. 
        Every plant serves a purpose and the only way to find the purpose is to discover it for yourself.
        When a medicine man does not know what medicine to use, the spirits of the plants instruct him.
