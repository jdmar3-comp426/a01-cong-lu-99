    <h1>Origins of Fire</h1>
    <p>In the beginning of the earth, long ago, 
        there was no fire and it was cold. 
        Then the Thunders beings, who live in the Above World, 
        sent lightning to put fire in a large, 
        hollow sycamore tree that grew on an island. 
        All the animals could see the smoke 
        but they didn’t know how to get to the fire. 
        They all met to decide what to do. First, they sent the Raven, 
        who was a strong flier and would surely succeed. 
        Raven landed on the sycamore tree but the heat scorched 
        his feathers black so he flew back without any fire. 
        Next, Screech Owl flew over, but when he looked down the hollow 
        trunk a strong blast of hot air nearly burned out his eyes 
        and they are red to this day. Hoot Owl and Horned Owl tried 
        but weren't successful either. The animals sent the snakes, 
        but they choked on the smoke before they could get close 
        enough to the fire. The rest of the animals were so fearful 
        they could only come up with reasons why not to go. Finally, 
        little Water Spider said she would do it. The other animals 
        knew she was fast over the water, but they doubted she could 
        bring back any fire. “I’ll manage,” she said. So, Water Spider 
        spun her thread into a small bowl on her back and then crossed 
        the water to the island and its burning tree. She collected 
        a small piece of coal from the fire and placed it in her 
        basket. Then she crossed back to the other animals. 
        The earth has had fire ever since.
